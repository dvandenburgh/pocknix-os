-- AYN Thor top screen: Chipone ICNA3520 OLED. gamescope drives only the top panel.
-- The panel exposes no EDID: gamescope synthesizes one (patch 0012) and matches this profile
-- on GAMESCOPE_INTERNAL_DEVICE_ID, which pocknix-steam sets to the board's POCKNIX_DEVICE
-- (0013). It supplies the colorimetry (nominal DCI-P3, not measured) and the HDR range;
-- Steam's display settings turn HDR on and off. Values from armada-os/armada's profile for
-- the same panel. The board's POCKNIX_PANEL_HDR_NITS must match max_content_light_level.
